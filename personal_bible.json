    "question": "Q. What is the biblcal argument for Presbyterianism?",
    "answer": "A. Biblical principles include: the plurality of elders (Acts 14; 20; Titus 1; 1 Pet. 5), connectionalism (Acts 15; Gal. 1:1-10; 1 Cor. 12), and representative government (Acts 6; 1 Cor. 16). This approach ensures that churches are governed by a team of leaders who are accountable to one another and to the congregation, and that decisions are made in a way that is guided by Scripture (2 Tim. 3; 2 Pet. 1). By following these principles, Presbyterianism seeks to promote unity, diversity, and biblical fidelity in the church (Eph. 4; 1 Cor. 12)."
