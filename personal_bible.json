WCF 7.2 states that the first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience. WSC 12 states that when God had created man, He entered into a covenant of life with him, upon condition of perfect obedience; forbidding him to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, upon the pain of death.<br>Scripture references include: Gen. 2:17; 3:15; Hos. 6:7; Jer. 33:20-21; Rom. 5:12-19."

    "question": "Q. What is the biblcal argument for Presbyterianism?",

Biblical principles include: the plurality of elders (Acts 14; 20; Titus 1; 1 Pet. 5), connectionalism (Acts 15; Gal. 1:1-10; 1 Cor. 12), and representative government (Acts 6; 1 Cor. 16). This approach ensures that churches are governed by a team of leaders who are accountable to one another and to the congregation, and that decisions are made in a way that is guided by Scripture (2 Tim. 3; 2 Pet. 1). By following these principles, Presbyterianism seeks to promote unity, diversity, and biblical fidelity in the church (Eph. 4; 1 Cor. 12)."

    "answer": "A. Episcopalian church government consists of a hierarchy of priests and bishops who have final authority in the government of the church.<br>Presbyterian church government affirms the importance of the 'connectional' nature of the church; that is, that each local congregation is 'connected' both doctrinally and in practice to other local congregations via presbyteries and the General Assembly. Each local church is governed by a session, each session is accountable to a presbytery, and every presbytery accountable to the General Assembly.<br>A Congregational church government views each local church as autonomous and self-governing, and sees no place for any official, governmental connection between local churches."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the principles of Presbyterian church government?",
    "answer": "A. Christ is the head of His church & the source of all its authority; Christ exercises His authority through the Word and His Spirit.<br>Christ has endowed His church with authority—with specific authority to its officers.<br>Each local church is ruled by a session, comprised of teaching and ruling elders called by Christ and recognized by the members of the church as their leaders.<br>Each local church is represented by chosen members of its session within a presbytery, a church court comprised of teaching and ruling elders from each church within a certain geographical area.<br>The denomination as a whole is represented in the General Assembly, which serves as the highest court of the church."
