That December brought the formation of the PC in the Confederate States of America. They would merge with the United Synod of the South and rename themselves PCUS in 1865.<br><br>The arrival of the 20th Century also introduced the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy and the Five Fundamentals in 1910, and Auburn Affirmation in 1924.
