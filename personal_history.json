Presbyterians placed an emphasis on the education of ministers and William Tennet founded the Log College in 1727 and it continued until his death in 1746. One of the earliest issues arose over the degree of subscription to the WCF required. After being tabled for a few years, in 1729 the Adopting Act was signed allowing for ministers to state 'scruples.'<br><br>The 1730-40s brought a series of revivals that swept through the American colonies, leading to increased emphasis on personal conversion and evangelism. This in turn brought a theological dispute between traditionalists (Old Side) and revivalists (New Side) over issues such as church government, worship, and evangelism, signified by Robert Cross' protestation in 1741. Reunification came in 1758.<br><br>The first national Presbyterian denomination formed in 1789 with the creation of a general assembly. The Second Great Awakening began at the close of the 18th century and would take on many moral and social issues, and result in schisms like the Cumberland Presbyterians. In 1801 the PCUSA would make the Plan of Union, an agreement with New England Congregationalist, yet within 30 years would lead to doctrinal division. During this time the Old School/New School Controversy arose—centered around differing views on theology, revivalism, and ecclesiastical governance. Old School proponents expelled four synods during the 1837 General Assembly resulting in Old School Presbyterians and New School Presbyterians.<br><br>The Old School Presbyterians passed the Gardiner Springs Resolution in 1861 to support the Federal Government with many Southern ministers not participating. That December brought the formation of the PC in the Confederate States of America. They would merge with the United Synod of the South and rename themselves PCUS in 1865.<br><br>The arrival of the 20th Century also introduced the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy and the Five Fundamentals in 1910, and Auburn Affirmation in 1924.
