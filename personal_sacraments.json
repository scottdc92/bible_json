    "question": "Q. What sacraments of the Old Testament are tied to the sacraments of the New Testament?",
    "answer": "A. Circumcision to Baptism: Circumcision, the sign of the covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:10-11), marked inclusion in God’s covenant community. In the New Testament, baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of the covenant (Colossians 2:11-12).<br><br>Passover to the Lord’s Supper: The Passover commemorated Israel's deliverance from Egypt through the blood of the lamb (Exodus 12:21-27). The Lord’s Supper, instituted by Christ during Passover (Luke 22:19-20), fulfills this by pointing to Jesus, the Lamb of God (1 Corinthians 5:7), whose sacrifice delivers believers from sin."

  {
    "question": "Q. What is the language of sign and seal in baptism?",
    "answer": "A. Baptism is an outward sign of one’s allegiance to and ownership by Jesus Christ. We are baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence, baptism serves as a public sign indicating one’s desire to be identified with God. Baptism is the visible ratification on the part of God that He indeed does forgive the sins of those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Rom. 4:11; Gen. 9:12-13; 17:11). The term 'seal' means that baptism is a guarantee and confirmation of the grace which it signifies (Rom. 2; 4; Ex. 12). This relates to paedo-baptism because when an infant is baptized, God is marking that child as His, and providing confirmation of His promise to bestow on that child the blessings of the covenant of grace."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Give a BRIEF explanation and defense of infant baptism.",
    "answer": "A. As the covenant sign of the OT was applied to infant males in circumcision, we baptize infants because they are included in the covenantal promise which is \"for you and your children\", and the children of believers are to be received into the covenant community and given the connected sign and seal (Acts 2, 16)."

For infant baptism see Gen. 17, Acts 2, 1 Cor. 7 (unbelieving spouse and children are sanctified by the believing spouse), Mark 10 and Luke 18 – where Jesus blesses the little children."
