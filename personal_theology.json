  {
    "question": "Q. What is Sabellianism/Modalism?",
    "answer": "A. Teaches that the unipersonal God reveals himself in three ‘modes.’ Denies the real, eternal distinction of the divine persons.

    "answer": "Christ died in the place of sinners to satisfy God’s divine wrath and reconcile us to God. Christ is the atonement sacrifice (Lev. 16), the lamb led to the slaughter (Is. 52-53). He is offered up on behalf of others. He atonement is a ransom for many (Mark 10) and became sin itself (2 Cor. 5) and redeemed us (Gal. 3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is universal atonement, and refute it?",
    "answer": "A. Universal atonement is the belief that Christ’s death was intended to atone for the sins of all individuals, without exception. It holds that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross made salvation universally possible but does not necessarily result in the salvation of all. It undermines the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ's work, suggesting His sacrifice could fail to save anyone who rejects it, thus depending on human action for its completion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is universalism, and refute it?",
    "answer": "A. Universalism is the belief that all people will ultimately be saved and reconciled to God, regardless of their faith in Christ or their actions in life.

    "question": "Q. What is the difference between total depravity, partial depravity, and absolute depravity?",
    "answer": "A. Total depravity means all aspects of humanity are affected by the fall, yet man is not as bad as he can be due to God's common grace.<br>Partial depravity means some aspects are affected, while part good.<br>Absolute depravity means man is completely and utterly depraved in all aspects."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the relationship between God's sovereignty and man's responsibility?",
    "answer": "A. God is an all-knowing and fully sovereign God, yet humanity is responsible for turning from sin and towards God, confessing Jesus Christ as Lord, and following Him, with two extreme positions (hyper-Calvinist and Arminian) erring by overemphasizing one or the other."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the error of hyper-Calvinism?",
    "answer": "A. Hyper-Calvinism overemphasizes God's sovereignty, erring on the side of not evangelizing and calling people to repent and follow Christ, because God will ultimately save those he has ordained to save, and fails to consider the means by which God has chosen to spread the seed of the gospel."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the error of Arminianism?",
    "answer": "A. Arminianism struggles to account for God's sovereignty and the sinful estate of humanity, emphasizing human responsibility and capacity in responding to the gospel call, and fails to recognize that those who repent and are delivered from sin do not merit it of their own efforts but are indebted solely to the grace of God."

  {
    "question": "Q. What is the extent of God's sovereignty?",
    "answer": "A. God has ordained whatsoever comes to pass, but he:<ul><li>is not the author of sin,</li><li>does not destroy the will of the creature,</li><li>destroy the liberty of second causes,</li><li>nor has he decreed based on something foreseen in the future</li></ul>"

  {
    "question": "Q. What is covenant theology and what is a covenant?",
    "answer": "A. The way in which God relates to humankind and stresses the unity of God’s plan of redemption throughout the entirety of Scripture. Unity and continuity of the Scriptures. One people, one story, one destination. Though there are particular covenants, each of them serves God’s greater, overarching covenant of redemption throughout all of Scripture.<br><br>Covenant – A binding contract between two parties which has stipulations and actions required of each party. “A bond in blood sovereignly administered.”"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How is covenant theology expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith?",

  {
    "question": "Q. Define the outward and inward calls of the gospel.",
    "answer": "A. The outward call of the gospel is any sharing of the gospel and proclamation of the good news.<br>The inward call is the effectual work of the Spirit. Effectual calling is a work of God’s Spirit, whereby convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and renewing our wills, he does persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us in the gospel."

    "answer": "A. Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God. (WSC 14)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is repentance?",
    "answer": "A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace, whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, does, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience. (WSC 87)<br><br>No sinner may expect pardon apart from repentance (Luke 13:3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Define faith and repentance. What is their relationship?",
    "answer": "A. Faith is a saving grace whereby we receive and rest upon Jesus Christ alone for salvation as he is offered to us in the gospel. Repentance unto life is a saving grace whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, does with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is justification?",
    "answer": "A. Justification is an act of God's free grace in which he pardons our sins, accepts us as righteous in his sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us and received by faith (WSC 33; Rom. 3; 2 Cor. 5; Phil. 3)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the relation of good works to faith?",
    "answer": "A. Good works are the fruit and evidence of faith (James 2:18, 22). James and Romans approach justification from different perspectives, with good works being the justification, or vindication, of faith."

  {
    "question": "Q. What is the doctrine of sanctification?",
    "answer": "A. Sanctification is a work of God’s free grace in which we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and enabled more and more to die unto sin and live unto righteousness (Eph. 4, Rom 8)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the relationship between justification and baptism?",
    "answer": "A. Justification is an act on God's part, while baptism is a sacrament and a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and does not effectually save nor cause one to be justified."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Compare and contrast justification and sanctification.",
    "answer": "A. Justification is an act of God in which he imputes the righteousness of Christ and sin is pardoned freeing us from the wrath of God. Sanctification is a work of God in which the Spirit infuses grace and sin is subdued and growing us up to perfection, never perfectly in this life."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Are good works necessary for salvation or may they save us?",
    "answer": "A. We would never be able to perform even the duty required (Luke 17:10).<br><br>Good works will not merit pardon from sin and cannot satisfy the debt of our prior sin (Eph 2:8-9)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How could a person know he is saved? On what could such assurance be based?",
    "answer": "A. Assurance is grounded in the promises of God (Heb 6:11-19; 1 John 3:24). This assurance of faith, founded upon the promises of salvation, is enabled by the Spirit with an internal witness."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What should a person do who lacks assurance of salvation?",
    "answer": "A. Daily repent of their sins and turn to Jesus, who offers life, with full assurance God will forgive our sins (1 John 1:9). While we desire to make our calling and election sure, our assurance is ultimately tied to the promises of God, who does not change."

    "question": "Q. Are there gifts mentioned in Scripture not given today and what were their purpose?",
    "answer": "A. Certain gifts mentioned in scripture (prophecy [as revelation], tongues, miracles, healing) seem to be strictly associated with the establishment of apostolic authority and the church. These gifts were given to reveal God’s gospel message and to confirm the messenger and his message."
