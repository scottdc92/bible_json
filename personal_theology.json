    "answer": "A. Modalism sees God as unipersonal and reveals himself in different modes, God the Father in the Old Testament, the Son in the New Testament, and the Spirit post-resurrection and the through the church.

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is Subordinationism?",
    "answer": "A. Subordinationism over emphasizes the distinction between the persons and understands the Son and Spirit as not being equal in power and glory because the Son is begotten and the Spirit proceeds—though most focus is given to the Son. Throughout the gospel accounts those who encounter Jesus worship him, which he should have forbidden if he was anything less than equal with God (Matt. 14). Thomas confesses “my Lord and my God” (John 20). Even the angels worship him (Heb. 1).<br><br>To be begotten causes the Son to be less than the Father and is an attack on his <em>true deity</em>."

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the error of hyper-Calvinism?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How does covenant theology differ from dispensational theology?",
    "answer": "A. Covenant theology sees a unified redemptive plan centered on Christ, interpreting Israel and the Church as one people of God.<br><br>Dispensational theology divides history into distinct periods in which God relates to humanity in specific ways. It often maintains a distinction between Israel and the Church and emphasizes the literal fulfillment of biblical prophecies regarding Israel."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the covenant of works (life)? Why is it important? Defend your answer from Scripture.",
    "answer": "A. The covenant made with Adam not only for himself, but for his posterity as he was our federal head; therefore all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in his first transgression. (Gen. 2; Rom. 5; Gal. 3)"

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Explain the doctrine of the incarnation. Why is it important?",
    "answer": "A. Jesus, being the eternal Son of God, became man by taking to himself a true body and a reasonable soul, being conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary and born of her, yet without sin.<br>The one who would offer himself as an atonement must be human, in order that he might fulfill the law. He must also be divine, as only his sacrifice would be efficacious."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the two natures of the person of Christ and how do the two natures relate to each another?  Why is this important?",
    "answer": "A. Jesus is truly divine and truly human and these two natures exist in a hypostatic union in which they are distinct but inseparably joined in one person. The divine does not override the human nor the human diminish the divine. There also exists the communication of attributes, such that what occurs out of one nature may be said of the whole, but does not transfer to the other nature.<br><br>As God he gives worth and efficacy to his suffering, obedience, and intercession, and satisfies God’s justice. As man he performs obedience to the law, suffers and makes intercession for us that we might receive the adoption of sons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe and defend substitutionary atonement.",
    "answer": "Christ died in the place of sinners to satisfy God’s divine wrath and reconcile us to God. Christ is the atonement sacrifice (Lev. 16), the lamb led to the slaughter (Is. 52-53).

  {
    "question": "What do you believe about the bodily resurrection and return of Christ?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is universal atonement, and refute it?",
    "answer": "A. Universal atonement is the belief that Christ’s death was intended to atone for the sins of all individuals, without exception. It holds that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross made salvation universally possible but does not necessarily result in the salvation of all. It undermines the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ's work, suggesting His sacrifice could fail to save anyone who rejects it, thus depending on human action for its completion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is universalism, and refute it?",
    "answer": "A. Universalism is the belief that all people will ultimately be saved and reconciled to God, regardless of their faith in Christ or their actions in life. This diminishes the seriousness of sin, undermines the justice of God, and contradicts the necessity of the gospel's call to repentance and faith."

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the relationship between salvation and good works? Do Paul and James contradict each other when they speak of justification and works?",
    "answer": "A. Good works are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith; we cannot, by our best works, merit pardon of sin, or eternal life. James and Romans approach justification from different perspectives, with good works being the justification, or vindication, of faith."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the doctrine of sanctification?",
    "answer": "A. Sanctification is a work of God’s free grace in which we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and enabled more and more to die unto sin and live unto righteousness (Eph. 4, Rom 8)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Compare and contrast justification and sanctification.",
    "answer": "A. Justification is an act of God in which he imputes the righteousness of Christ and sin is pardoned freeing us from the wrath of God. Sanctification is a work of God in which the Spirit infuses grace and sin is subdued and growing us up to perfection, never perfectly in this life."

  {
    "question": "Q. What is repentance?",
    "answer": "A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace, whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, does, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience. (WSC 87)<br><br>No sinner may expect pardon apart from repentance (Luke 13:3)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Define faith and repentance. What is their relationship?",
    "answer": "A. Faith is a saving grace whereby we receive and rest upon Jesus Christ alone for salvation as he is offered to us in the gospel. Repentance unto life is a saving grace whereby a sinner, out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, does with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience."

  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Are believers under obligation to the law today? Defend with scripture proofs.",
