  {
    "question": "Q. What are means of grace?",
    "answer": "A. They are the ordinary ways, or means (media gratia), that God has appointed for our growth in the grace of Christ. They are God’s appointed instruments by which the Holy Spirit enables believers to receive Christ and the benefits of redemption.<br>The Word, sacraments, and prayer (Matt. 28:19; Acts 2:41-42).<br>The Word may be broken into the preaching and reading of it (WSC 89)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is a sacrament?",
    "answer": "A. A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ, wherein, by sensible signs, Christ and the benefits of the new covenant are represented, sealed, and applied to believers. (WSC 92) (Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 10:16).<br>Simplified – An outward sign accompanied by an inward grace that strengthens and increases one’s faith (Rom. 4:11; 15:8; Ex. 12:48; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 10:21; 12:13)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How many sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. Christ instituted two sacraments in His church.<br>Two: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Matt. 28:18-20 indicates the commandment to baptize believers (note – there is no commandment to continue circumcision). In Matt. 26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, Luke 22:14-19, and 1 Cor. 11:23-30, Jesus (and Paul) commands His followers to participate in the Lord’s Supper or Communion.<br>Baptism replaced the Old Testament covenantal sign of circumcision, and the Lord’s Supper took the place of the Old Testament Passover meal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How are sacraments a sign?",
    "answer": "A. A sign is a visible element that represents a spiritual reality. In the case of sacraments, the sign is the physical element (water, bread, wine) that points to the spiritual reality (union with Christ, forgiveness of sins). The sign is not the reality itself, but rather, it is a pointer to the reality."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How are sacraments a seal?",
    "answer": "A. A seal is a confirmation or guarantee of the spiritual reality represented by the sign. In sacraments, the seal is the assurance that the spiritual reality is truly present and being conveyed to the believer. The seal is not just a promise, but a guarantee that the reality is being imparted."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Who may administer the sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. Lawfully ordained ministers (WCF 27.4)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Where are sacraments to be administered?",
    "answer": "A. As part of the public worship of God; they are not to be administered in private."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the criteria for determining a sacrament?",
    "answer": "A. Explicitly instituted by Christ as an ordinance in His church that continues until He returns (Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 11:26).<br>An external, sensible sign and seal of the benefits of Christ's mediation of the covenant of grace."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Is foot washing a sacrament? Why?",
    "answer": "A. Foot-washing is not a sign and seal of the benefits we receive from Christ's mediation of the covenant of grace, but rather a symbol of the acts of humility and service that we should perform (Jn.13:13-16).<br>Foot-washing was not instituted as an ordinance that continues until Christ returns (Jn. 13:13-16; cf. Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 11:26).<br>There is no evidence that the apostles or early church practiced foot-washing as a sacrament, but there is ample evidence that they practiced baptism and the Lord's Supper."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Does anything happen in a sacrament?",
    "answer": "A. Yes, but it is not always seen or noticed – WCF 27.3 notes that the grace exhibited in or by the sacraments is not conferred by any power within them nor by the piety or intention of the one administering them. Grace is conferred by the Holy Spirit working in and by the word of institution.<br>The benefits of Christ's mediation are signified and sealed (1 Cor. 10:16).<br>Our faith is nourished and strengthened (Gal. 3:26-27).<br>We are obliged to obedience (Rom. 6:3-4).<br>We testify to our love for one another (1 Cor. 10:17).<br>We are distinguished from unbelievers (Eph. 2:11-12)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Compare OT sacraments and NT sacraments.",
    "answer": "A. Baptism and circumcision:<br>- Col. 2:11-12<br>- Acts 2:39, cf. Gen. 17:9-14<br>Lord's Supper and Passover:<br>- Matt. 26:26-28, cf. Ex. 12<br>- 1 Cor. 10:16-18 (Israel eating sacrifices)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How are sacraments related to the written and preached Word?",
    "answer": "A. The Word and the sacraments:<br>- Have the same author (2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Cor. 11:23-25)<br>- Have the same content (1 Cor. 1:23; 11:26)<br>- Require faith as the means to appropriate the content (1 Cor. 1:21; Col. 2:12)<br>But the Word takes priority over the sacraments, because it:<br>- Is essential for salvation, while the sacraments are not (Rom. 10:14-15; 4:11)<br>- Engenders and strengthens faith, while the sacraments only strengthen it (Rom.10:17; Gal. 3:26-27)<br>- Is intended for the whole world, while the sacraments are only intended for the church (Rom.10:12-17; Eph. 2:11-12)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How are the sacraments a means of grace?",
    "answer": "A. They are a means of grace by the working of the HS in those who receive them by faith as they nourish the believer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How are the sacraments a means of grace? How are they effectual?",
    "answer": "A. The sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him that does administer them; but only by the blessing of Christ, and the working of his Spirit in them that by Faith receive them. (WSC 91)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the Reformed view of sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. The sacraments are signs and seals that the Holy Spirit uses to confer divine grace when that grace is received by faith (Gal. 3:26-27; Col. 2:12).<br>There are two sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper (Matt. 28:19; 26:26-28)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the Roman Catholic view of sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. The sacraments confer grace by the work performed (ex opre operato), apart from the faith of the recipient.<br>Objection: Gal. 3:26-27 and Col. 2:11-12 both say faith is necessary to appropriate the grace offered in a sacrament.<br>There are 7 Sacraments: Baptism, Communion, Confirmation, Penance, Marriage, Ordination, Last Rights / Extreme Unction.<br>Objection: The last 5 of these were either not instituted by Christ as an ordinance that continues until he returns, or do not signify the benefits of Christ's mediation, or both. Therefore, they do not meet the definition of a sacrament (Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 10:16)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the Lutheran view of sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. Baptism – Baptism is a means of God’s grace, through which God creates and/or strengthens the gift of faith in a person’s heart and forgives sins. New birth (regeneration) occurs at baptism. Baptism should be followed by conversion.<br>Lord’s Supper – In the Lord’s Supper, the true body and blood of Christ are received in, with, and under the bread and wine (consubstantiation). It is the same Christ who died, but he is present is in a different manner than he was corporeally present when he walked bodily on earth."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the Baptist view of sacraments?",
    "answer": "A. Sacraments are not means of grace, but merely symbols of it. Objection: Scripture teaches that the sacraments are signs and seals that the Holy Spirit uses to confer divine grace when that grace is received by faith (Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12).<br>There are two sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.<br>Baptist view of baptism according to Schaff: They teach that believers only ought to be baptized, that is, dipped or immersed, on a voluntary confession of their faith. They reject infant baptism as an un-scriptural innovation and profanation of the sacrament, since an infant cannot hear the gospel, nor repent and make a profession of faith. They believe, however, in the salvation of all children dying before the age of responsibility. Baptism in their system has no regenerative and saving efficacy: it is simply an outward sign of grace already bestowed, a public profession of faith in Christ to the world, and an entrance into the privileges and duties of church membership."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree?",
    "answer": "A. \"The Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper agree, in that the author of both is God; the spiritual part of both is Christ and his benefits; both are seals of the same covenant, are to be dispensed by ministers of the gospel and by none other; and to be continued in the Church of Christ until his second coming.\" (WLC 176)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ?",
    "answer": "A. \"The Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ, in that Baptism is to be administered but once, with water, to be a sign and seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ, and that even to infants; whereas the Lord’s Supper is to be administered often, in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as spiritual nourishment to the soul, and to confirm our continuance and growth in him, and that only to such as are of years and ability to examine themselves\" (WLC 177)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is baptism?",
    "answer": "A. Baptism is a sacrament, wherein the washing with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matt. 28), does signify and seal our ingrafting into Christ (Gal. 3); and partaking of the benefits of the covenant of grace (Acts 2); and our engagement to be the Lord's (Rom. 6)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the language of sign and seal in baptism?",
    "answer": "A. Baptism is an outward sign of one’s allegiance to and ownership by Jesus Christ. We are baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence, baptism serves as a public sign indicating one’s desire to be identified with God. Baptism is the visible ratification on the part of God that He indeed does forgive the sins of those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Rom. 4:11; Gen. 9:12-13; 17:11). The term 'seal' means that baptism is a guarantee and confirmation of the grace which it signifies (Rom. 2; 4; Ex. 12). This relates to paedo-baptism because when an infant is baptized, God is marking that child as His, and providing confirmation of His promise to bestow on that child the blessings of the covenant of grace."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the reason to baptize infants?",
    "answer": "A. As the covenant sign of the OT was applied to infant males in circumcision, we baptize infants because they are included in the covenantal promise which is \"for you and your children\", and the children of believers are to be received into the covenant community and given the connected sign and seal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Explain the relationship between baptism and regeneration.",
    "answer": "A. Baptism is an outward sign, a visible setting apart and reminder of God’s promise. Regeneration is the work of the Spirit and is not tied to baptism as a necessary result. Of those being baptized after confessing their faith in and obedience unto Christ, baptism is a 'sign and seal… of regeneration' (WCF 28.1)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the mode of baptism?",
    "answer": "A. Baptism is properly administered by pouring or sprinkling water (Heb. 9; Acts 2). Immersion is permitted but not necessary. Baptism signifies purification from sin (John 3; Acts 2). This purification is described in terms of sprinkling in Heb. 9-10 and Ezek. 36. Baptism also signifies regeneration by the Holy Spirit (Tit. 3), and Scripture often speaks of the Spirit being poured out (Joel 2; Acts 2; 10). This is why sprinkling or pouring are the prescribed modes of baptism. But immersion is permitted, because it can also symbolize purification."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Who is to be baptized?",
    "answer": "A. Those who profess faith and obedience in Jesus Christ and the infant children of believing parents (one, or both) – WCF 27.4. For profession of faith baptism, see Acts 2 (Peter on Pentecost), Mark 16:15-16 (Jesus and His Great Commission), Acts 8 (Ethiopian Eunuch). For infant baptism see Gen. 17, Acts 2, 1 Cor. 7 (unbelieving spouse and children are sanctified by the believing spouse), Mark 10 and Luke 18 – where Jesus blesses the little children."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How is baptism administered?",
    "answer": "A. First, it must be performed by a minister of the gospel, lawfully called thereto (WCF 27.3, 4; Matt. 16).<br>Second, it must be done in the name of the triune God (Matt. 28:18-20).<br>Third, the element to be used is water (1 Peter 3; Matt. 3).<br>Fourth, the mode ought to be sprinkling, which signifies purification from sin. Since the imagery of baptism involves cleansing from sin by being sprinkled by the blood of Christ, our sacrifice, the mode of sprinkling is to be used (also see Heb. 10, 12, 1 Peter 1; John Murray, Christian Baptism, pp 7-30 for more detail)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Does baptism save the person baptized?",
    "answer": "A. We must be considerate of our language around this idea. 1 Peter 3:21 clearly states baptism, which corresponds with Noah’s ark in the flood, saves. Nevertheless, Scripture does not put forward the idea that baptism causes regeneration (ex opere operato), nor is it taught that baptism is necessary for salvation or else one is condemned—Cornelius was already a God-fearer (Acts 10). Baptism does not save by the efficacy of the water or in some magical way, as if the water washes away our sins. Baptism is a sign of the concrete reality taking place. God’s promise of being a God unto this person and their ingrafting into the visible body of Christ is the reality behind the sign. A king’s coronation is not the moment they become king, but the manifestation and declaration to the public of the reality which has already taken place (also consider wedding/marriage imagery). By faith we may enter into the fulness of what baptism means and that is salvation, of belonging to God as the bride of Christ."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Can a person be baptized more than once? Explain and defend with Scripture proofs.",
    "answer": "A. Technically no. We might be tempted to say yes, and only in extreme circumstance – for instance, if one were baptized in the Mormon cult, that baptism would not be valid since it was not done in the name of the triune God (Matt. 28). Hence that person would need to be rebaptized upon his profession of faith (or by his parent’s profession of faith if he is still a child). However, we would argue that the baptism was not a true baptism, and so they are being baptized for the first time. Other proofs: see Eph. 4, Gal. 3, Titus 3:5 (washing = baptism – see Murray handout from E & E lectures which discuss various words used to describe baptism) also see Eph. 5."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the Roman Catholic view of baptism?",
    "answer": "A. It is a sacrament of initiation, washing away of original sin, infusion of sanctifying grace, and a permnanent spiritual mark. It is also necessary for salvation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How is our baptism to be improved upon?",
    "answer": "A. Living out and deepening our understanding of the grace and promises signified in baptism, our union with Christ and the benefits of being effectually called."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is the meaning of the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. The Lord's Supper is a symbolic representation of the Lord's death, a symbol of the believer's participation in the crucified Christ, a symbol of our need to be nourished by Him for sustenance, and a symbol of the union that believers have with one another."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the four signs of the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. 1. It is a symbolic representation of the Lord's death (1 Cor. 11:26). 2. It symbolizes the believer's participation in the crucified Christ (John 6:53). 3. It symbolizes our need to be nourished by Him for sustenance. 4. It symbolizes the union that believers have with one another as they share the elements and reflect on God's grace in pardoning their sins."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the four seals of the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. 1. The Lord's Supper seals to the participant the great love of Christ, revealed in the fact that He surrendered Himself to a shameful and bitter death for them. 2. It pledges the believing partaker of the sacrament, not only the love and grace of Christ, but gives him the personal assurance that all the promises of the covenant and all the riches of the gospel are his by divine donation. 3. It assures the believer that the blessings of salvation are his in actual possession. 4. It is a badge of profession on the part of those who partake of the sacrament, professing their faith in Christ and proclaiming their allegiance to Him as their king."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What 'happens' in the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. In one sense, nothing happens to the elements in the Lord’s Supper. The elements do not take on literal properties of Christ’s body and blood as Catholics believe (transubstantiation). Neither does Christ’s physical presence locally fill the elements as Lutherans believe (consubstantiation).<br>In another sense, much happens in the Lord’s Supper: As Calvin taught, Christ is present in the sacrament, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. His presence enables believers to enjoy a mystical communion with Him as they are nourished by Christ in a figurative sense (John 6). Believers are also encouraged to remember Christ’s life and sacrificial death on their behalf ('do this in remembrance of me'). Finally, believers anticipate the day when they will be fully seated with Him in the Kingdom of God enjoying His presence forever."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What is communion 'under both kinds'?",
    "answer": "A. Communion 'under both kinds' refers to the practice of administering the Eucharist in both forms—both the consecrated bread (the body of Christ) and the consecrated wine (the blood of Christ) to the laity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. What are the four major view of the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. Transubstantiation - the bread and wine are miraculously turned into the physical body and blood of Christ.<br><br>Consubstantiation – the physical presence of Christ locally fills the elements (in, on and around the bread and wine).<br><br>Memorialist – holds that the Lord's Supper is strictly a memorial to Christ's death and nothing else. Zwingli was not truly a 'bare memorialist' because he said the church was the body of Christ and the mystical work happened to the people, not the elements.<br><br>Reformed – The elements remain unchanged during the Lord's Supper, yet Christ is present, and believers enjoy a mystical communion with Him, nourishing and strengthening one's soul through the mediating work of the Holy Spirit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Is Christ in any sense present in the Lord's Supper? If so, how?",
    "answer": "A. Yes. He does not inhabit the elements, but He is present in the ceremony in a spiritual sense, mediated by the Holy Spirit, and conditioned on the act of faith by which the communicant symbolically receives the body and blood of Christ."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How do we worthily feed upon Christ in the sacrament?",
    "answer": "A. By faith, receiving and applying unto themselves Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death, in a spiritual manner, while the elements themselves are to their outward senses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Who should take part in the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. Those who are of years and ability to examine themselves—generally those who have made professions of faith. Paedocommunion is denied in WLC 177 and 1 Cor. 11."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How should believers celebrate the Lord's Supper?",
    "answer": "A. As a commemoration, remembering His life, death and ministry for us; as a communion with Christ whereby He nourishes and feeds their souls as they participate in the sacrament by faith; and as an anticipation of the day when we reign with Christ forever."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How is 'fencing the table' practiced during communion?",
    "answer": "A. By instructing those in attendance that the table is open for their participation if they have made a profession of faith, and reminding them of Paul's words in 1 Cor. 11:27-30 which warn against participation in this sacrament in an unworthy manner."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. Who may be kept from the Lord's table?",
    "answer": "A. Such as are found to be <u>ignorant or scandalous</u>, notwithstanding their profession of the faith, and desire to come to the Lord's Supper, may and ought to be kept from that sacrament, by the power which Christ has left in his church, until they receive instruction, and manifest their reformation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Q. How do we handle 1 Corinthians 11 and padeo-communion?",
    "answer": "A. The PCA has rejected padeo-communion as an error in its position paper and argues that Paul in 1 Corinthians 11 sets forth the requirement of being able to 'examine themselves so that they may distinguish the body of the Lord and not eat and drink unworthily.'"
